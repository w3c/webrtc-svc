    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to extend the WebRTC 1.0 API
    to enable user agents to support scalable video coding (SVC).</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This specification extends the WebRTC specification [[WEBRTC]] to
    enable configuration of encoding parameters for scalable video coding (SVC). 
    Since SVC bitstreams are self-describing and SVC-capable codecs implemented
    in browsers require that compliant decoders be capable of decoding any
    legal encoding sent by an encoder, this specification does not support
    decoder configuration. However, it is possible for decoders that cannot
    decode any legal bitstream to describe the supported scalability modes.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>The term <dfn>simulcast envelope</dfn> refers to the maximum number of
      simulcast streams and the order of the encoding parameters.</p>
    <p>This specification references objects, methods, internal slots and dictionaries defined in
    [[!WEBRTC]]</p>
       <p>For Scalable Video Coding (<dfn>SVC</dfn>), the terms single-session transmission
      (<dfn>SST</dfn>) and multi-session transmission (<dfn>MST</dfn>) are
      defined in [[RFC6190]]. This specification only supports <a>SST</a> but
      not <a>MST</a>.</p>
      <p>The term Single Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream
      Single Transport (<dfn>SRST</dfn>), defined in [[RFC7656]] Section 3.7,
      refers to SVC implementations that transmit all layers within a
      single transport, using a single RTP stream and synchronization source
      (SSRC). The term Multiple RTP stream Single Transport (<dfn>MRST</dfn>),
      also defined in [[RFC7656]] Section 3.7, refers to implementations that
      transmit all layers within a single transport, using multiple RTP streams
      with a distinct SSRC for each layer.  This specification only supports
      <a>SRST</a> transport, not <a>MRST</a>. Codecs with RTP payload
      specifications supporting <a>SRST</a> transport include VP8
      [[RFC7741]], VP9 [[VP9-PAYLOAD]], AV1 [[AV1-RTP]] and H.264/SVC
      [[RFC6190]].</p>
  </section>
  <section id="operational-model">
    <h2>Operational model</h2>
    <p>This specification extends [[!WEBRTC]] to enable configuration of encoding
    parameters for Scalable Video Coding (SVC), as well as discovery of the SVC capabilities of both an
    encoder and decoder, by extending the {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters}}
    and {{RTCRtpCodecCapability}} dictionaries.</p>
    <p>Since this specification does not change the behavior of WebRTC
    objects and methods, restrictions relating to Offer/Answer negotiation and
    encoding parameters remain, as described in [[!WEBRTC]] Section 5.2: 
    "{{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} does not cause SDP renegotiation and can
    only be used to change what the media stack is sending or receiving within the
    envelope negotiated by Offer/Answer."</p>
    <p>The configuration of SVC-capable codecs implemented in browsers fits within this
    restriction. Codecs such as VP8 [[RFC6386]], VP9 [[VP9]] and AV1 [[AV1]] mandate support
    for SVC and require a compliant decoder to be able to decode any compliant encoding
    that an encoder can send. Therefore, for these codecs there is no need to
    configure the decoder or to negotiate SVC support within Offer/Answer, enabling
    encoding parameters to be used for SVC configuration.</p>
    <section id="error-handling">
      <h2>Error handling</h2>
      <p>
        [[!WEBRTC]] Section 5.2 describes error handling in
        {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}}, including use of {{RTCError}}
        to indicate a {{RTCErrorDetailType/"hardware-encoder-error"}}
        due to an unsupported encoding parameter, as well as
        {{OperationError}} for other errors. Implementations of this
        specification utilize {{RTCError}} and {{OperationError}}
        in the prescribed manner when an invalid
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value is provided to 
        {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} or {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} and
        {{RTCRtpTransceiver/setCodecPreferences()}} methods are called
        prior to conclusion of the Offer/Answer negotiation, the negotiated
        codec and its capabilities may not be known. In this situation the
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values configured
        in {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} may not be supported
        by the eventually negotiated codec. However, an error will result only
        if the requested {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value is
        invalid for any supported codec. To determine whether the requested
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values have been applied,
        an application can call the {{RTCRtpSender.getParameters()}} method
        after negotiation has completed and the sending codec has been determined.
        If the configuration is not satisfactory, the
        {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} method can be used to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note that where SVC support is negotiated in SDP Offer/Answer,
        {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} can only change
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values within the envelope
        negotiated by Offer/Answer, resulting in an error if the requested
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value is outside this envelope.
        When {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} is used to
        request the sending of multiple simulcast streams using
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}, it is not possible to
        configure the sending of "S" scalability modes. The browser
        may only be configured to send simulcast encodings with
        multiple SSRCs and RIDs, or alternatively, to send all
        simulcast encodings on a single SSRC. Attempting to
        simultaneously utilize both simulcast transport
        techniques MUST return {{OperationError}} in
        {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} or
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="negotiation">
      <h2>Negotiation</h2>
      <p>
        So as to ensure that the desired {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
        values can be applied, {{RTCRtpTransceiver/setCodecPreferences()}} can be
        used to limit the negotiated codecs to those supporting the desired configuration.
        For example, if temporal scalability is desired along with spatial simulcast,
        when {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} is called,
        {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} can be configured to send multiple
        simulcast streams with different resolutions, with each stream
        utilizing temporal scalability. If only the VP8, VP9 and AV1 codec implementations
        support temporal scalability, {{RTCRtpTransceiver/setCodecPreferences()}}
        can be used to remove the H.264/AVC codec from the Offer, guaranteeing that
        a codec supporting temporal scalability is negotiated.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are situations where a peer may only support reception of a subset
        of codecs and scalability modes. For example, an SFU that parses codec
        payloads may only support temporal scalability modes with the VP8 and
        VP9 codecs. As another example, a browser that can decode any VP8
        scalability mode may not support VP9 or AV1 at all, and may only
        support decoding of H.264/SVC temporal scalability modes.
        In these situations, the {{RTCRtpReceiver}}'s <code>getCapabilities</code>
        method can be used to determine the scalability modes supported by
        the {{RTCRtpReceiver}}, and the {{RTCRtpSender}}'s
        <code>getCapabilities</code> method can be used to determine
        the scalability modes supported by the {{RTCRtpSender}}. After
        exchanging capabilities and computing their intersection, the application
        can compute the intersection of the
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values supported by both the
        local and remote peers. These values can then be provided to the
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} and {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the capabilities of the SFU receiver, an application can determine
        whether the SFU supports receiving simulcast encodings on a single SSRC,
        and if so, the maximum number of encodings the application can send to
        the SFU. For example, an SFU that can only support reception of a maximum
        of 2 simulcast encodings on a single SSRC with the AV1 codec would only
        indicate support for the "S2T1" and "S2T1h" scalability modes in its
        receiver capabilities.

                  The {{scalabilityModes}} sequence represents the scalability modes supported
                  by a user agent. While the user agent's SVC capabilities are assumed to be static, this
                  may not be the case for a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU), whose ability to forward SVC
                  modes may depend on the negotiated header extensions.  For example, if the SFU cannot parse
                  codec payloads (either because it is not designed to do so, or because the payloads are
                  confidential), then negotiation of an RTP header extension (such as the AV1 Descriptor
                  defined in Appendix A of [[AV1-RTP]] or frame marking [[FRAME-MARKING]]) may be required
                  to enable the SFU to forward scalability modes.  As a result, an application may choose
                  to exchange {{scalabilityModes}} with an SFU after the initial offer/answer
                  negotiation, so that the SFU's supported {{scalabilityModes}} can be determined,

     <p>The scalability modes supported in this specification, as well as their associated

     all the modes defined in the table, other codecs cannot. For example, VP8
     [[RFC7741]] only supports temporal scalability (e.g. "L1T2", "L1T3"). H.264/SVC
     [[RFC6190]], which supports both temporal and spatial scalability, only permits
     transport of simulcast on distinct SSRCs, so that it does not support the

      <h3>Guidelines for addition of {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values</h3>
      <p>When proposing a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value, the following principles should be followed:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The proposed {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} MUST define entries to the table in
            Section 6, including values for the Scalabilty Mode Identifier, spatial and
            temporal layers, Resolution Ratio and Inter-layer dependency.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Scalability Mode Identifier SHOULD be consistent with naming schemes used
            in existing specifications such as [[AV1]] Section 6.7.5. The AV1 naming scheme
            utilizes  <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var></code> to denote a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} with <var>x</var>
            spatial layers using a 2:1 resolution ratio and <var>y</var> temporal layers.
            <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>h</code> denotes <var>x</var> spatial layers with a 1.5:1 resolution ratio and
            <var>y</var> temporal layers. <code>S<var>x</var>T<var>y</var></code> denotes a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
            with <var>x</var> simulcast encodings with a 2:1 resolution ratio, with each
            simulcast encoding containing <var>y</var> temporal layers. <code>S<var>x</var>T<var>y</var></code> denotes
            a 1.5:1 resolution ratio. In addition, [[AV1]] Section 6.7.5 defines <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>_KEY</code>
            and <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>_KEY_SHIFT</code> modes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the new {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} does not reference a dependency diagram
            defined within an existing specification, then a dependency diagram MUST be
            supplied.

    <h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour, but
    instead summarizes information already present in other parts of the
    specification. WebRTC protocol security considerations are described
    in [[RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]] and the security and privacy considerations
    for the WebRTC APIs are described in [[WEBRTC]] Section 13.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistent information</h2>
      <p>The WebRTC API exposes information about the underlying media system
      via the {{RTCRtpSender}}<code>.getCapabilities</code> and
      {{RTCRtpReceiver}}<code>.getCapabilities</code> methods, including
      detailed and ordered information about the codecs that the system is able
      to produce and consume. The WebRTC-SVC extension adds the
      {{RTCRtpCodecCapability/scalabilityModes}} supported by the {{RTCRtpSender}}
      to that information, which is persistent across time, therefore increasing
      the fingerprint surface. Since for SVC codecs implemented in WebRTC
      compliant decoders are required to be able to decode all scalability modes,
      additional information is not provided relating to the {{RTCRtpReceiver}}.</p>
      <p>Since for SVC codecs implemented in WebRTC the use of scalable coding tools
      is not negotiated and is independent of the supported profiles, the
      {{RTCRtpCodecCapability/scalabilityModes}} supported by the {{RTCRtpSender}}
      does not provide additional information on the underlying hardware.
      Since browsers may differ in their support for SVC modes, the supported
      {{RTCRtpCodecCapability/scalabilityModes}} may initially permit differentiation
      between browsers. This additional fingerprint surface is expected to decrease
      over time as this specification is more widely implemented.</p>
