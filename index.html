      This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to extend the WebRTC 1.0 API
      to enable user agents to support scalable video coding (SVC).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p>
      The API is based on preliminary work done in the W3C ORTC Community Group.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This specification extends the WebRTC specification [[WEBRTC]] to
      enable configuration of encoding parameters, as well as the
      discovery of Scalable Video Coding (SVC) encoder capabilities. The
      discovery of decoder capabilities and configuration of decoding
      parameters is not supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this specification does not change the behavior of WebRTC
      objects and methods, restrictions relating to Offer/Answer negotiation and
      encoding parameters remain, as described in [[WEBRTC]] Section 5.2:
      "{{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}} does not cause SDP renegotiation and can
      only be used to change what the media stack is sending or receiving within the
      envelope negotiated by Offer/Answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration of SVC-capable codecs implemented in browsers fits within this
      restriction. Codecs such as VP8 [[?RFC6386]], VP9 [[?VP9]] and AV1 [[?AV1]] do not
      negotiate SVC support within Offer/Answer, enabling encoding parameters to be used
      for SVC configuration.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="conformance">
    <p>
      This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
      product: the user agent that implements the interfaces that it
      contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
      implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. In
      particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
      easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
      this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
      ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as
      this specification uses that specification and terminology.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The term "simulcast envelope" is defined in [[!WEBRTC]] Section 5.4.1. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification references objects, methods, internal slots
        and dictionaries defined in [[!WEBRTC]].
      </p>
      <p>
        For Scalable Video Coding (SVC), the terms "single-session transmission"
        (<dfn>SST</dfn>) and "multi-session transmission" (<dfn>MST</dfn>) are
        defined in [[?RFC6190]]. This specification only supports <a>SST</a> but
        not <a>MST</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "Single Real-time Transport Protocol stream Single Transport"
        (<dfn>SRST</dfn>), defined in [[RFC7656]] Section 3.7, refers to SVC
        implementations that transmit all layers within a single transport,
        using a single Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream and
        synchronization source (SSRC). The term "Multiple RTP stream Single
        Transport" (<dfn>MRST</dfn>), also defined in [[RFC7656]] Section 3.7,
        refers to implementations that transmit all layers within a single
        transport, using multiple RTP streams with a distinct SSRC for each layer. 
        This specification only supports <a>SRST</a>, not <a>MRST</a>. Codecs
        with RTP payload specifications supporting <a>SRST</a> include VP8
        [[?RFC7741]], VP9 [[?VP9-PAYLOAD]], AV1 [[?AV1-RTP]] and H.264/SVC
        [[?RFC6190]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "S mode" refers to a scalability mode in which multiple
        encodings are sent on the same SSRC. This includes the [="S2T1"=], [="S2T1h"=],
        [="S2T2"=], [="S2T2h"=], [="S2T3"=], [="S2T3h"=], [="S3T1"=], [="S3T1h"=], [="S3T2"=], [="S3T2h"=],
        [="S3T3"=] and [="S3T3h"=] {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term <dfn data-lt="SFM" data-noexport>Selective Forwarding Middlebox</dfn>
        (SFM) is defined in Section 3.7 of [[RFC7667]].
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn data-noexport data-idl data-dfn-for="VideoConfiguration">spatialScalability</dfn>
        is an addition to {{VideoConfiguration}} in the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-capabilities/#dom-videoconfiguration-spatialscalability">Media Capabilities API</a>.
      </p>

  <section id="configuration">
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
      <p>
        This specification enables the configuration of encoding parameters for SVC 
        by extending the {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters}} dictionary.

          [[!WEBRTC]] describes error handling in {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}}

           {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}}. To validate
           {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}, add
           the following steps after step 3 of
           [=RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver sendEncodings validation steps=]:
           <ol>
             <li>
               If <var>sendEncodings</var> contains any encoding with a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters}}.codec
               value <var>codec</var> [=map/exists=] and where the same encoding's {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
               value is not supported by <var>codec</var>, [= exception/throw =] an {{OperationError}}.
             </li>
             <li>

               {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value is 
               not supported by any codec in the [=RTCRtpSender/list of implemented send codecs=]
               for <var>kind</var>, [= exception/throw =] an {{OperationError}}.
             </li>
             <li>
               If {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters}} stored in
               <var>sendEncodings</var> contains more than 1
               encoding with an {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/active}}
               member with a value of <code>true</code> and
               <var>sendEncodings</var> contains any encoding whose
               {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value
               represents an "S mode" and whose
               {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/active}} member has a
               value of <code>true</code>, [= exception/throw =] an
               {{OperationError}}.
             </li>
           </ol>
         </p>
         <p>
           When the {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} and
           {{RTCRtpTransceiver/setCodecPreferences()}} methods are called
           prior to conclusion of the Offer/Answer negotiation, the negotiated
           codec and its capabilities may not be known. In this situation the
           {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values configured
           in {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} may not be supported
           by the eventually negotiated codec. However, an error will only result
           if the requested {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value is
           invalid for any supported codec, or if mixed simulcast transport is requested.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as to ensure that the desired {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
          values can be applied, {{RTCRtpTransceiver/setCodecPreferences()}} can be
          used to prefer or only include codecs supporting the desired configuration.
          For example, if temporal scalability is desired along with spatial simulcast,
          when {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} is called,
          {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} can be configured to send multiple
          simulcast streams with different resolutions, with each stream
          utilizing temporal scalability. If only the VP8, VP9 and AV1 codec implementations
          support temporal scalability, {{RTCRtpTransceiver/setCodecPreferences()}}
          can be used to remove the H.264/AVC codec from the Offer, improving the
          chances that a codec supporting temporal scalability is negotiated.
        </p>
        <p>
          When {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} is used to
          request the sending of multiple simulcast streams using
          {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}}, an "S mode" cannot
          be requested. The browser may only be configured to send
          simulcast encodings with multiple SSRCs and RIDs, or
          alternatively, to send all simulcast encodings on a single
          RTP stream. Simultaneously using both simulcast transport
          techniques is not permitted.

    <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p>
        The [[?Media-Capabilities]] API provides information on encoder support
        for spatial scalability modes. {{VideoConfiguration//scalabilityMode}} is
        used to query whether an encoder has the ability to support this mode.
        The <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a>
        can provide information on the codecs and scalability modes it can
        decode by providing its receiver capabilities.
        After exchanging capabilities, the application can compute the
        intersection of codecs and {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
        values supported by the browser's {{RTCRtpSender}} and the
        <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a>'s receiver. This
        can be used to determine the arguments passed to the browser's
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} and {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters()}}
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The [[?Media-Capabilities]] API also provides information on decoder support
        for spatial scalablity modes. {{VideoConfiguration/spatialScalability}}
        indicates whether a decoder has the ability to support spatial prediction,
        which requires the ability to use frames of a resolution different than
        the current resolution as a dependency. If {{VideoConfiguration/spatialScalability}}
        is set to <code>true</code>, the decoder can decode any
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value supported by the encoder.
        If {{VideoConfiguration/spatialScalability}} is set to <code>false</code>
        or is absent, the decoder cannot decode spatial scalability modes, but can
        can decode all other {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values
        supported by the encoder.

      <section id="sfmnegotiation">
        <h2>Negotiation</h2>
          <p>
            There are situations where an <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a>
            may only support reception of a subset of codecs and scalability modes.
            For example, an <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a> that parses
            codec payloads may only support the H.264/AVC codec without scalability and
            the VP8 codec with temporal scalability. On the other hand, the browser
            may be able to encode VP8 with temporal scalability, VP9 with temporal
            and spatial scalability and or H.264/AVC with temporal scalability.
            In such a situation, an application desiring to use SVC would only
            be able to encode VP8 with temporal scalability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since sending simulcast encodings on a single stream is not negotiated within
            Offer/Answer, an application using SDP signaling needs to determine whether
            single stream simulcast transport is supported prior to the Offer/Answer negotiation.
            This can be handled by having the <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a>
            send it's receiver capabilities to the application prior to Offer/Answer.
            This allows the application to determine whether single stream simulcast is
            supported, and if so, what scalability modes the
            <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a> can handle. For example,
            an <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a> that can only support
            reception of a maximum of 2 simulcast encodings on a single SSRC with the
            AV1 codec would only indicate support for the [="S2T1"=] and [="S2T1h"=] scalability
            modes in its receiver capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
           For an <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a> the supported
           {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values may depend on the negotiated RTP
           header extensions.  For example, if the <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a>
           cannot parse codec payloads (either because it is not designed to do so, or
           because the payloads are encrypted), then negotiation of an RTP header extension
           (such as the AV1 Dependency Descriptor defined in Appendix A of [[?AV1-RTP]])
           could be a prerequisite for the <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a>
           to forward a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value. As a result,
           the {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values supported by an
           <a title="Selective Forwarding Middlebox">SFM</a> may not be determined until
           completion of the Offer/Answer negotiation.

      below. The names of the {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values (which are
      case sensitive) are provided, along with the scalability mode identifiers assigned in
      [[?AV1]] Section 6.7.5, and links to dependency diagrams provided in Section 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the [[?AV1]] and VP9 [[?VP9]] specifications support all the
      {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values defined in the table, other codec
      specifications do not. For example, VP8 [[?RFC6386]] only supports temporal scalability
      (e.g. [="L1T2"=], [="L1T3"=]); H.264/SVC [[?RFC6190]], which supports both temporal and
      spatial scalability, only permits transport of simulcast on distinct SSRCs, so that it
      does not support "S" modes, where multiple encodings are transported on a single RTP stream.

      <h3>Guidelines for addition of {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} values</h3>
      <p>When proposing a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} value, the following principles should be followed:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The proposed {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} MUST define entries to the table in
            Section 6, including values for the Scalabilty Mode Identifier, spatial and
            temporal layers, Resolution Ratio, Inter-layer dependency and the corresponding
            AV1 scalability_mode_idc value (if assigned).
          </li>
          <li>
            The Scalability Mode Identifier SHOULD be consistent with the existing naming scheme, which
            utilizes <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var></code> to denote a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} with <var>x</var>
            spatial layers using a 2:1 resolution ratio and <var>y</var> temporal layers.
            <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>h</code> denotes <var>x</var> spatial layers with a 1.5:1 resolution ratio and
            <var>y</var> temporal layers. <code>S<var>x</var>T<var>y</var></code> denotes a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
            with <var>x</var> simulcast encodings with a 2:1 resolution ratio, with each
            simulcast encoding containing <var>y</var> temporal layers. <code>S<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>h</code> denotes
            a 1.5:1 resolution ratio. <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>_KEY</code> denotes a {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}}
            with <var>x</var> spatial layers using a 2:1 resolution ratio and <var>y</var> temporal layers in which spatial layers only
            depend on lower spatial layers at a key frame. <code>L<var>x</var>T<var>y</var>_KEY_SHIFT</code> modes denotes a
            {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} with <var>x</var> spatial layers using a 2:1 resolution ratio and
            <var>y</var> temporal layers in which spatial layers only depend on lower spatial layers at a key frame and subsequent
            frames have their temporal identifier shifted upward.
          </li>
          <li>
            A dependency diagram MUST be supplied, in the format provided in Section 10.

        <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
     <p>
       This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour, but
       instead summarizes information already present in other parts of the
       specification. The privacy considerations
       for the WebRTC APIs are described in [[WEBRTC]] Section 13.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistent information</h2>
      <p>
        Since for SVC codecs implemented in WebRTC the use of scalable coding tools
        is not negotiated and is independent of the supported profiles, and since SVC
        is rarely supported in hardware encoders, knowledge of the
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} supported by the {{RTCRtpSender}}
        does not provide additional information on the underlying hardware.
        However, since browsers may differ in their support for SVC modes, the supported
        {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/scalabilityMode}} may permit differentiation
        between browsers. This additional fingerprint surface is expected to decrease
        over time as this specification is more widely implemented.
